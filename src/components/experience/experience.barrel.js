        Training with Erica Judd:
        <p>
          Over the past 2 weeks, and some time to come, I have trained along
          side Erica to prepare new hires for their time on the phone. I have
          been able, through my own time on the phone, to give my personal
          experience and further their knowledge before even handling a call.
          I've been able give them a plethora of skills & knowledge that will
          not only better them, but have a positive reflection on us.

        Assisting new hires
        <p>
          While my 'formal' training here at Interapt only extends to what's
          recorded with Erica, I have a proven record of assisting new hires
          when possible. Either through text or video, I've been able to help
          other CSA's with issues they've struggled with and have gone above and
          beyond in ensuring that they're not facing the same issue down the
          line.

        Self Improvement
        <p>
          I by no means consider myself the "best" but I strive to be. I train
          myself daily by reading KB's & previous tickets to further improve by
          own skillset
