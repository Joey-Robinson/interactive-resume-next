        Training Myself
        <p>
          Through my own dilligence and persistence, I have become an incredible
          asset at Cracker Barrel. I've worked tireslessly to provide the best
          possible experience for guests - similar to my call taking abilities -
          that are coming and going from Cracker Barrel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through either asking endless questions, to trial and error, I have
          become an expert of sorts in the world of Cracker Barrel retail.
          Because of this, my customer (guest) services have grown daily and
          continue to grow now.

        Training new hires
        <p>
          When someone joins the retail team of Cracker Barrel, I'm often the
          one to train them. I try my best to not only inspire them and give
          them confidence, I give them the freedom to make their own decisions.
          Doing this allows me to train an individual quickly and seemlessly.
          This also has the added benefit of allowing me to instill confidence
          in a new hire, which can often be the single most important skill.
